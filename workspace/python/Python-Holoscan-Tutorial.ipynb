    "### Scheduler Selection\n",
    "It is essential to select the right scheduler for your use case at hand to ensure optimal performance and efficient resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Holoscan SDK offers the following schedulers:\n",
    "* Greedy Scheduler: This basic single-threaded scheduler tests conditions in a greedy manner. Suitable for simple use cases and provides predictable execution. However, it may not be ideal for large-scale applications as it may incur significant overhead in condition execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* MultiThread Scheduler: It is designed to handle complex execution patterns in large-scale applications. This scheduler consists of a dispatcher thread that periodically polls the status of each operator and dispatches it to a thread pool of worker threads responsible for executing them. Once execution is complete, worker threads enqueue the operator back on the dispatch queue. The MultiThread Scheduler offers superior performance and scalability over the Greedy Scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Event-Based Scheduler: The event-based scheduler is also a multi-thread scheduler, but as the name indicates it is event-based rather than polling based. Instead of having a thread that constantly polls for the execution readiness of each operator, it instead waits for an event to be received which indicates that an operator is ready to execute. The event-based scheduler will have a lower latency than using the multi-thread scheduler with a long polling interval (check_recession_period_ms), but without the high CPU usage seen for a multi-thread scheduler with a very short polling interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set the MultiThread or Event-based scheduler for your app, it is simple via `app.scheduler()`.\n",
