# NVIDIA Holoscan

From radio telescopes to particle accelerators, scientific instruments produce tremendous amounts of data at equally high rates. To handle this data deluge and to ensure the fidelity of the instruments’ observations, architects have historically written measurements to disk, enabling downstream scientists and researchers to build applications with pre-recorded files. The future of scientific computing is AI-centric, interactive, and streaming; how many Nobel Prizes are hidden on a dusty hard drive that a scientist didn’t have time or resources to analyze? NVIDIA® Holoscan is the solution.

NVIDIA Holoscan is the sensor processing platform that streamlines the development and deployment of AI and high-performance computing (HPC) applications for real-time insights. Accelerating the full workflow, it offers the software and hardware needed to build AI applications and deploy sensor processing capabilities from edge to cloud. From surgery to satellites, Holoscan helps companies explore new capabilities, accelerate time to market, and lower costs.

Together with the OpenACC organization, NVIDIA will host a virtual Holoscan Bootcamp on September 24, 2024. This Bootcamp focuses on building an end-to-end AI-enabled streaming pipeline using the Holoscan SDK, handling sensor I/O, applying a trained AI model to a real time sensor stream, and building GPU accelerated applications. We will also discuss techniques to measure application performance and transition from prototype to production.

This online Bootcamp is a hands-on learning experience where attendees will be guided through step-by-step instructions with teaching assistants on hand to help throughout.
